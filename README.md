# Purple rAIn
### The simplest neural network in existence (8 lines of code with no dependency)

Run:
``` python
> python .\purple_rain.py "150,100,150"
> purple
```

yes, they are. The neural network encodes multiple choices in a single matrix (your model) whereby each node is an if condition and each weight is the activator of such condition.

PS: of course this is a very poor AI with very low accuracy. It can only categorize 2 colors and the weights were defined at my own taste (they dont even really matter).
